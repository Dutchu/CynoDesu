Key Points to Consider
Centralize Error Handling: Use a single approach to handle errors rather than mixing multiple strategies (@ControllerAdvice, custom ErrorController, and Security configurations). Choose one method for application-wide consistency.

Clear Responsibilities:

@ControllerAdvice: Handles exceptions thrown by controllers and maps them to appropriate error views.
ErrorController: Manages error responses triggered by HTTP status codes (like 404, 500) at a global level.
Security Configuration: Manages access denied and authentication failures.
Error Pages Setup:

Error views like 404.html, 500.html, etc., should be located in /templates/error/.
Consistently map error handling configurations to these views.

Understanding the Different Error Handling Implementations
You have several mechanisms in place for handling errors in your Spring MVC application. Here's a breakdown of how they function and interact with each other:

@ControllerAdvice (ControllerAdviceExceptionHandler):

Purpose: Handles exceptions thrown within your application's controllers. It provides a way to return custom error views and messages based on the exception type.
Use Case: Ideal for handling application-specific exceptions, like NullPointerException, ResourceNotFoundException, or business logic-related exceptions. It's well-suited for returning detailed error views to the user with custom messages.
Flow: When an exception occurs in a controller and it's caught by a handler method in @ControllerAdvice, the corresponding error view is returned. This is especially useful for exceptions that are not related to security.
Custom ErrorController (CustomErrorController):

Purpose: Manages HTTP error responses (like 404, 500) at a global level. It intercepts errors that have propagated up to the error dispatching mechanism (typically HTTP status code-based errors).
Use Case: Good for handling errors that occur outside the scope of controller advice, such as missing URLs (404 errors) or generic server errors (500 errors). It is the last resort after the exception has propagated through all other layers.
Flow: When a URL does not match any controller or resource handler, or when there is an internal server error that isn't explicitly handled by a @ControllerAdvice, the ErrorController provides the error view.
Custom Security Filter (CustomSecurityFilter):

Purpose: Handles security-related exceptions, such as authentication failures (AuthenticationException) and access denials (AccessDeniedException). It intercepts requests and redirects or forwards them to appropriate error views based on security rules.
Use Case: Useful when dealing with unauthorized access attempts (403 errors) or when the user needs to be authenticated (401 errors). This is particularly important for securing parts of your application and redirecting unauthorized users appropriately.
Flow: If a security-related exception occurs (e.g., user is not authenticated or lacks the required role), the custom filter intercepts it and forwards to a specified error page, such as /error/403.
How They Interact
ControllerAdvice handles exceptions that occur in your application logic and is invoked when exceptions are thrown by controllers.
ErrorController deals with global error handling for HTTP status codes, especially those that aren't caught by ControllerAdvice.
Security Module (via Security Filter Chain) intercepts security-related issues like forbidden access, and these are often handled by a combination of CustomSecurityFilter and ControllerAdvice.
Relation with Security and Error Handling
Security Layer:

The security layer (configured in DevSecurityConfig) is responsible for managing access control. If a user tries to access a restricted resource, the security layer will throw an AccessDeniedException.
Security exceptions are caught by the CustomSecurityFilter which then redirects to specific error views (e.g., 403 Forbidden).
Flow of Exception Handling:

Application Exceptions: Handled by @ControllerAdvice.
HTTP Errors: Handled by CustomErrorController.
Security Exceptions: Handled by CustomSecurityFilter and possibly forwarded to the ErrorController if further handling is needed.
Simplifying for Use Cases in MVC Applications
For a typical MVC application where you want to return views with messages regarding exceptions:

Use @ControllerAdvice for handling most application exceptions and returning meaningful error views to the user. This keeps your error handling localized to the application logic.
Rely on CustomErrorController for general HTTP errors like 404 and 500, ensuring all missing resources and unexpected errors are covered.
Use CustomSecurityFilter for handling all security-related exceptions, redirecting to appropriate error views for unauthorized access attempts.
Example Use Case:
A user tries to access a restricted page without proper permissions:
Security Filter Chain detects insufficient permissions, throws an AccessDeniedException.
CustomSecurityFilter intercepts and redirects to /error/403.
If a further unhandled error occurs, CustomErrorController takes over to display a fallback error page.
By structuring your error handling in this way, you create clear boundaries and responsibilities for handling exceptions, making it easier to manage and extend as your application grows. Let me know if there's a specific scenario you'd like further clarification on!
