Workflow for Creating and Adding Dogs to Competitions and Certification Process
Dog Creation (User Flow):

Users go to the "Dog Management" page and fill out a form to create a new dog.
Upon submission, the dog entry is set to "Pending" status and awaits admin review.
Admins access the "Review and Approval" page, review the entry, and either accept or reject it.
Competition Registration (User Flow):

Users visit the "Competition Registration" page, choose a competition, and select one or more dogs to register.
The registration entry is set to "Pending" status and awaits admin review.
Admins access the "Review and Approval" page, review the competition entries, and either accept or reject them.
Certification Process (Admin Flow):

Admins access the "Review and Approval" page to see all new entities needing approval (dogs, competition entries, etc.).
They can approve or reject entries, with options to provide feedback or request additional information from users.
Score Assignment (Admin Flow):

After a competition, admins go to the "Scores Management" page to assign and update scores for each dog.
Once all scores are entered, they can finalize the results, which will be visible to users.
Suggested Tools and Technologies
Frontend Framework: Use a modern frontend framework like React or Vue.js to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Backend: Utilize Spring Boot to handle server-side logic, including RESTful APIs for managing dogs, competitions, and scores.
Thymeleaf Templates: Use Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of templates if you want to keep the app simple and avoid heavy JavaScript on the frontend.
Real-Time Updates: Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets to push real-time notifications to users (e.g., when their dog or competition entry is approved).
User Experience Enhancements
Notification System: Implement a notification system that alerts users when their entries are approved, rejected, or need additional information.
Search and Filter: Provide search and filter functionality on all major pages to help users and admins quickly find the information they need.
Pagination: Implement pagination on lists (e.g., dogs, competitions) to manage large data sets efficiently.
Responsive Design: Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Conclusion
This suggested UI system should provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for both users and admins to manage dogs, competitions, and scores efficiently. By implementing these features, you can ensure a smooth workflow for creating, reviewing, and approving entities while maintaining a clear distinction between user and admin functionalities.
