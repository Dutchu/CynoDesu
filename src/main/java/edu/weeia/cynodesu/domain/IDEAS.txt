Alternative Approaches
URL References: Instead of encoding images directly, you can store images in a file storage (like AWS S3 or your server's file system) and send a URL reference to the image in your DTO. This approach:

Reduces payload size.
Utilizes browser caching.
Allows images to be loaded lazily or on demand.
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): If the images are static, use a CDN to serve them. Send URLs to the view layer, which can benefit from faster loading times and caching.

Blob Storage: For applications that require handling large images, consider using blob storage. This method keeps the images separate from the main data payload and only loads them when necessary.

UUIDs for DOGS as universal ID shared across platforms. Alternatively Develop system like PESEL
